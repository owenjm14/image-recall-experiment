      This consent form is part of an informed consent process for a research study, and it will provide information that will help you decide whether you want to take part in this study. The Principal Investigator of the research study is Owen Martin. It is your choice to take part or not. <br><br>
      The purpose of this research is to examine individuals' ability to visualize and recall images from memory. If you take part in the research, you will be asked to view a series of images of household rooms, answer questions relating to them, and complete two short online questionnaires and demographic questions. You will need a device with a computer mouse. Your time in the study will be self-paced, taking approximately thirty minutes. <br><br>
      Potential harms or burdens of taking part of the study may include eye strain from focusing on on-screen images. It is recommended that you take short vision breaks between sections to minimize this strain. <br><br>
      There are no direct benefits to participants from the research; however, it will help researchers better understand the process of visualizing and interpreting images in the mind. <br><br>
      If you have any questions now or during the study, if you choose to take part, you should feel free to ask them and should expect to be given answers you completely understand. <br><br>
      I will not collect any information that can identify you or other subjects. Responses will be converted to a spreadsheet format and stored on a password-protected database that can only be accessed by me. I plan to delete the data by the end of March 2024. <br><br>
      <u>By continuing with the study, you have acknowledged that you have read the entire informed consent and are at least 18 years of age.  Also, you acknowledge that you agree to take part in the study and have the right to not answer any or all of the questions in the study.  Finally, you understand your participation is completely voluntary, and you may quit the study at any time without penalty.</u> <br><br><br>
